					<h6><em>Less counting when bowling </em></h6>
				</header>
				<p>
					It is normal these days that when you are bowling the points get counted without you having to do anything&#46; However&#44; this was not always the case&#46;
					Before the computer was added to bowling one had to count their own points&#44; now the computer is there it can do the counting for you&#46;
					So&#44; you can just focus on throwing the ball the right way so you get as many points as you can&#46;

					<h6><em>Less debating over the true winner </em></h6>
				</header>
				<p>
					Photo finish has been a great way to identify who has crossed the line first&#46; 
					Of course&#44; you can time the racers and see the difference in time there&#46;
					But if two people are crossing the finish a few milliseconds apart it is hard for the human eye to see&#46;
					So&#44; when the camera came that can take three thousand frames per second it is now very easy to figure out who crossed the line first&#46;

					<h6><em>No more fighting over unknown truths </em></h6>
				</header>
				<p>
					Before technology was intertwined with sport fights would break out over the choices of the referee&#46;
					But since camera&#39;s were placed around the playing fields the extend of those fight have become less severe&#46;
					Of course&#44; people do still disagree with the choices of the referee&#44; but now there is prove that someone either broke or followed the rules&#46;
					You can just watch back the footage if you need to know for sure&#46;
