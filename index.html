					Less counting when bowling 
				</header>
				<p>
					It is normal these days that when you are bowling the points get counted without you having to do anything. However, this was not always the case.
					Before the computer was added to bowling one had to count their own points, now the computer is there it can do the counting for you.
					So, you can just focus on throwing the ball the right way so you get as many points as you can.

					Less debating over the true winner 
				</header>
				<p>
					Photo finish has been a great way to identify who has crossed the line first. Of course, you can time the racers and see the difference in time there. But if two people are crossing the finish a few milliseconds apart it is hard for the human eye to see.
					So, when the camera came that can take three thousand frames per second it is now very easy to figure out who crossed the line first.

					No more fighting over unknown truths 
				</header>
				<p>
					Before technology was intertwined with sport fights would break out over the choices of the referee.
					But since camera's were placed around the playing fields the extend of those fight have become less severe.
					Of course, people do still disagree with the choices of the referee, but now there is prove that someone either broke or followed the rules.
					You can just watch back the footage if you need to know for sure.
