					<h6><em>What is the photofinish</em></h6>
				</header>
				<p>
					The photofinish is the camera that is going to make sure everyone know you are the one who got first&#46;
					The camera takes about 3000 frames &#40;aka pictures&#41; per SECOND&#46;
					All of those frames are to sure we get every movement to prove who crossed the line first&#46;
					There are mutiple sizes that you can buy&#44; the bigger the camera the better it will prevorm&#46;
					But that will also mean it cost more ofcourse&#46;

				<p>
					Have you ever ran a race on the field at school&#63;
					And if you did&#44; finish as number one in the race&#63;
					Maybe you even crossed the line and thought you won the race&#46;
					Only to discover after that the person behind you crossed the line at almost the exact same time&#44; and now nobody knows who crossed the line first&#46;
					You ended up having to share the first place to keep it fair&#44; but you were unhappy about it&#46;
					Well no more this invention will make sure that you always know who crossed the line first&#46;

					<h6><em>How to use the photofinish</em></h6>
				</header>
				<p>
					The camera is very easy to use&#44; you only have to set it by the finishline of whatever race you want to keep track of&#46;
					To point the lens to finshline&#44; turn on the camera and as last thing you have to hook up the camera to a computer and active the program&#46;
					The program is to make sure every frame gets saved safely on the computer for use so they do not overload the camera&#44; and it is easier to look at all the photo&#39;s to find the one you want&#46;

					<h6><em>The future of photofinish</em></h6>
				</header>
				<p>
					We are planning to keep upgrading our camera&#39;s until this company will be shutting down&#46;
					We strive to keep on top of all the new tech that comes out&#46;
					You can expect one camera that you can buy a year&#46;
					And a new computer program three times a year&#44; this will also need to be purchased&#46;
					We hope our quality will keep improving for the years to come&#44; and for so long we exist&#46;
