					What is the photofinish
				</header>
				The photofinish is the camera that is going to make sure everyone know you are the one who got first.
				The camera takes about 3000 frames (aka pictures) per SECOND.
				All of those frames are to sure we get every movement to prove who crossed the line first.
				There are mutiple sizes that you can buy, the bigger the camera the better it will prevorm.
				But that will also mean it cost more ofcourse.

					Why you need this product
				</header>
				Have you ever ran a race on the field at school?
				And if you did, finish as number one in the race?
				Maybe you even crossed the line and thought you won the race.
				Only to discover after that the person behind you crossed the line at almost the exact same time, and now nobody knows who crossed the line first.
				You ended up having to share the first place to keep it fair, but you were unhappy about it.
				Well no more this invention will make sure that you always know who crossed the line first.

					How to use the photofinish
				</header>
				The camera is very easy to use, you only have to set it by the finishline of whatever race you want to keep track of.
				To point the lens to finshline, turn on the camera and as last thing you have to hook up the camera to a computer and active the program.
				The program is to make sure every frame gets saved safely on the computer for use so they do not overload the camera, and it is easier to look at all the photo's to find the one you want.
